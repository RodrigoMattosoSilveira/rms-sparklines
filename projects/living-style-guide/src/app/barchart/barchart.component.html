            Description
            ----
            The `rms-spark-barchart` web component renders four distinct bar chart types, as per the `chartType` attribute:
            1. `positive`: Positive charts' bars with positve heights are drawn northward; bars with negative heights are cropped out.
            1. `negative`:  Negative charts' bars with negative heights are drawn southward; bars with positive heights are cropped out.
            1. `dual`: Dual charts' bars heights are negative, zero, or positive, with a positive height bars drawn northward and negative ones southward.
            1. `tri`: Tri charts have negative, zero, and positive bars. The positive and negative bars are half of the box height, whereas the aero bar is one fouth of it. Negative bara are drawn sothward, zeros stradding the x-axis, and positives northward.

        ### Usage
        Below is example of a barchar sparkline. In this example, sparkline is being declared as a child of an Angular component, with its attribute values being set at the Angular's component controller.

        ````html
            &lt;rms-spark-barchartt
                [barGap] = "barGap"
                [barHeights] = "barHeights"
                [chartType] = "chartType"
                [className] = "className"
                [fillColorMinus] = "fillColorMinus"
                [fillColorPlus] = "fillColorPlus"
                [fillColorZero] = "fillColorZero"
                [height] = "height"
                [minimumBarWidth] = "minimumBarWidth"
                [width] = "width"
            &gt;
            &lt;/rms-spark-barchart&gt;
        ````

        #### Properties
        * `barGap: number`: The that bar gap, in pixels.
        * `barHeights: string`: The heights of the bars to be built.
        * `chartType: string`: The chart type, one of ['positive', 'negative', 'dual', 'tri']
        * `className: string`: A classe names to be added to the canvas element. Default is no classes.
        * `fillColorMinus: string`: The color to render negative bars.
        * `fillColorPlus: string`: The color to render positive bars.
        * `fillColorZero: string`: The color to render zero bars.
        * `height: number`: The height of the sparkline box in pixels.
        * `minimumBarWidth`: number**: The minimum bar width, in pixels.
        * `width: number`: The width of the sparkline box in pixels. See the source for comments on how to fit bars into the provided box.

        #### barHeights
        The heights of the bars to be built.
        ````typescript
            barHeights: string = JSON.stringify([4, 3, 7, 8, 1, 4, 9, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5, 8 , 9, 7, 1]);
        ````
